Here my term project files can be found.

# Index:

# 1- dataset:
            I will collect data from different sources in this folder.
# 2- feature_dictionary
            I will define features and their id numbers and descriptions for which I will use in training.
# 3- raw_training_data
            This folder will include the raw training data that consists of the features I define in folder no.2
# 4- single_factor_analysis
            I will analyze each feature's single c-values and information values to determine which features are meaningful.
# 5- multi_factor_analysis
            I will check for multicollinearity between features to prevent possible overfitting in this folder.
# 6- training_test_data
            I will end up with a final traning and test data and include them in this folder.
# 7- feature_selection
            I will use some feature selection algorithms. This folder will include Python code for them.
# 8- model_selection
            Finally, I will fit the training data to some model (Random Forest, Logistic Regression etc.).
# 9- reports
            This folder will include the reports I will write during the project.
